A new window will pop out and search for 'interpreter' in the search bar. Then click the '+' button to search for the necessary packages. ![image2](https://github.com/Schiiite/Individual-Project/blob/main/img_folder/3.png)  
  
In order to run all the files, you may need to install the following packages, including: 'numpy', 'pandas', 'plotly', and 'dash'.  
After you've done all the steps above, copy all the files to the working environment, and try to build and run them.
